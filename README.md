# TracVision L2 RV Satellite - Microwave Imaging
A collection of Python utility scripts and a PoC script for microwave imaging the sky using a TracVision L2 Portable RV Satellite over Serial.

### Scripts
* serial_terminal.py: A rudimentary serial terminal for interfacing with the L2 controller over serial, compatible with Linux and Windows.
* scan.py: A rudimentary PoC that builds on my research to hopefully develop a script capable of automatically microwave imaging the sky (or section of the sky) via returned RF signal strength.
* More To Come
